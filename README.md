# casino-image-viewer For IPad
i made this up to speed up proccess of checking casino game images. It is not clean and does not work perfrectly, but good enough. 
How it works.
You need to log in to dropbox account in the main menu.
Then open csv file with games. It will load them one by one. And mark if they are good or bad.
Good games that is already checked it will be skipped.
Games that was edited is saved to dropbox. Then images of those games are shared using the link. Link is changed so it easier to download father in the progress.
Later you can export that file in folder called casino. 
Additionally you can draw on image, crop it, move it.
